Hey guys! This past semester, I dove deep into a research project in Professor Deepa Thomas's lab at UT Austin, 
where her group specializes in *Quark Gluon Plasma* (QGP). This post aims to give readers a overview of particle 
physics theory. After, be sure to give my [Pythia studies]({{< ref "posts/pythia/index.md" >}})
 a read to see how 
we can use particle collision data to probe at these theories!

# The Standard Model

In physics, all known interactions between matter and energy can be attributed to the four fundamental forces of nature.

1. **The Gravitational Force**

    Gravity is the weakest force but dominates on large scales due to its infinite range. It governs orbital dynamics and the motion of galaxies, and is described by Einstein’s General Relativity as the curvature of spacetime. Gravity has its quirks, as it doesn’t fit into the Standard Model, and while the graviton is theorized as its carrier, it hasn’t been detected.


1. **The Electromagnetic Force**

    The strong force is, well, as the name suggests, the strongest of the four forces, and it holds protons and neutrons together in the atomic nucleus. It only acts over extremely short distances (~$10^{-15}$ m), and is mediated by gluons which binds quarks together to form hadrons.

1. **The Weak Force**

    The weak force governs processes like beta decay and powers fusion in stars. It acts at subatomic scales and is mediated by the W and Z bosons. Uniquely, it can change quark flavor — like turning a neutron into a proton during decay.



4 fundamental forces, standard model

<!-- asymptotic freedom, color confinement -> only see hadrons

hadrons, decay routes, final state particles



how do we study?

detector kinematics

rapidity being lorentz invariant, look at slides for the kinematic variables cylindrical etc, cross sections 

QGP, heavy particles high temp high pressure
signatures being jet quenching, flow, strangeness enhancement

summary

go into code. lets visualize how kinematic correlations occur.  -->


list of things to talk about 
- what is QGP, why do we care to probe it
- basic beamline stuff
- kinematics
- link ravi's thesis
