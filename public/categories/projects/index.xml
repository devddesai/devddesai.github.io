      <description>Throughout my senior year at UT, I&amp;rsquo;ve been taking astronomogy and cosmology courses out of personal interest. As you may know, dark energy is supposedly responsible for the accelerated expansion of the universe. In this blog post, I will discuss my team&amp;rsquo;s research on the temporal evolution of dark energy through analysis of the DESI (Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument) and DES (Dark Energy Survey) datasets. Our code can be found here.</description>

      <description>A full repository of this project can be found here.
In my junior year, I took an independent research course under Dr. Deepa Thomas whose work specializes in High Energy Physics and Quark Gluon Plasma. A common research method in this field is to use a Monte Carlo event generator, such as Pythia, to simulate particle collision data at extremely high energy. This post will cover my analysis of the kinematic correlations of charmed hadrons.</description>

Introduction The goal of this project is to simulate the behavior of a bike-sharing system in a network of stations and destinations, and then optimize the positions of the stations. We approach the simulation of the bike-sharing system with Agent Based Modeling (ABM).</description>
