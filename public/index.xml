      <description>Very soon, I will publish my project implementing a linear interpolant/flow matching to Andrej Karpathy&amp;rsquo;s nanoGPT architecture to this page!
Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve been interested in novel generative techniques. We&amp;rsquo;ve seen the advent of diffusion over the past few years. Diffusion transformers are the gold standard for modern-day image generation, and there has been a lot of research on using diffusion for language modeling, sparked by the famous LLaDa model. Newer advancements include hybrid LLMs built on &amp;ldquo;Block Diffusion&amp;rdquo; to take advantage of diffusion&amp;rsquo;s parallel token generation whilst utilizing autoregression&amp;rsquo;s flexible-length generation and KV Caching.</description>

      <title>Temporal Evolution of Dark Energy</title>

      <description>Throughout my senior year at UT, I&amp;rsquo;ve been taking astronomogy and cosmology courses out of personal interest. As you may know, dark energy is supposedly responsible for the accelerated expansion of the universe. In this blog post, I will discuss my team&amp;rsquo;s research on the temporal evolution of dark energy through analysis of the DESI (Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument) and DES (Dark Energy Survey) datasets. Our code can be found here.</description>

      <title>An Overview of Autoencoders</title>

      <description>For my 2-D Ising Model project, I was reading up on Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs), which are generative models used in machine learning – especially for generating images. To better understand how DDPMs work, I decided to explore some of the foundational models they build upon, which led me to autoencoders, and specifically, variational autoencoders.
In this post, I’ll give a brief overview of autoencoders and introduce two variants: the variational autoencoder (VAE) and the sparse autoencoder (SAE).</description>

      <title>Kinematic Correlations of Charmed Hadrons</title>

      <description>A full repository of this project can be found here.
In my junior year, I took an independent research course under Dr. Deepa Thomas whose work specializes in High Energy Physics and Quark Gluon Plasma. A common research method in this field is to use a Monte Carlo event generator, such as Pythia, to simulate particle collision data at extremely high energy. This post will cover my analysis of the kinematic correlations of charmed hadrons.</description>

      <description>This project was done as our final project for William Gilpin&amp;rsquo;s Graduate Computational Physics Course. Our complete GitHub repository, with instructions on how to replicate our results, can be found here.

Introduction The goal of this project is to simulate the behavior of a bike-sharing system in a network of stations and destinations, and then optimize the positions of the stations. We approach the simulation of the bike-sharing system with Agent Based Modeling (ABM).</description>
