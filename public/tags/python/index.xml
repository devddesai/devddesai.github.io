      <description>Simple Statistical Modeling Rolling window for average and volatility Monte Carlo use $\mu$ and $\sigma$ to simulate thousand of possible game outcomes probaility of winning into a fair value price adjust our fair value price with the tru emarket price. we assume we have some edge to the market. Real fair = 0.7 our fair + 0.3 market fair Market Making Provide liquidity to the market assuming the fair value and that people will want to trade at that fair value.</description>

      <description>Hey guys! This past semester, I dove deep into a research project in Professor Deepa Thomas&amp;rsquo;s lab at UT Austin, where her group specializes in Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP). This post aims to give readers a overview of particle physics theory. After, be sure to give my insert link a read to see how we can use particle collision data to probe at these theories!
The Standard Model In physics, all known interactions between matter and energy can be attributed to the four fundamental forces of nature.</description>

      <description>This project was done as our final project for William Gilpin&amp;rsquo;s Graduate Computational Physics Course. Our complete GitHub repository, with instructions on how to replicate our results, can be found here.

Introduction The goal of this project is to simulate the behavior of a bike-sharing system in a network of stations and destinations, and then optimize the positions of the stations. We approach the simulation of the bike-sharing system with Agent Based Modeling (ABM).</description>
