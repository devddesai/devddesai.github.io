    Title: Hi there!
    Content: >-
      I'm a senior at The Univeristy of Texas at Austin majoring in 
      Physics & Math with minors in Business, Computer Science, and Computational Science & Engineering. I am interested in computational physics,
      scientific machine learning, and quantitative finance. Here's just a little blog about some interesting things I've worked on and read at my time
      here. **I am currently in the process of migrating all my projects to this site, so many of the posts are still incomplete.**
